## What This Is

$m⊙^{2}$ is a bare-metal operating kernel written in Rust (no_std, x86_64) that replaces the traditional OS stack with a single self-verifying loop. There are no processes, no scheduler, and no filesystem hierarchy. Instead, every execution state is a point in a 17.28-million-entry type space called the Crystal, and storage is navigated by address rather than path.

The kernel runs on the 12-opcode IMASM instruction set. Each tick executes a single IMASM token, and the grammar constrains what each token does to the current state. Every tick is a self-verification: the Frobenius identity μ∘δ = id is enforced by the grammar rather than by a kernel API.

**Target:** x86_64-unknown-none (bare-metal ELF boot, zero external crates)  
**License:** Unlicense (public domain)  
**Total codebase:** ~30,000 lines of Rust

## Core Architecture

### The Crystal of Types  

The 12 primitives of the Imscribing Grammar define a type space of 17,280,000 addresses. Every object in the kernel — programs, data structures, witness proofs — is an address in this space. Navigation is by address lookup, not path traversal.

### The Frobenius Loop  

The kernel's main loop is `THINK → ACT → OBSERVE → UPDATE`. Each phase corresponds to IMASM opcodes:  

- **THINK:** Read the boundary (⊢ VINIT)
- **ACT:** Advance and compose (> AFWD, ⋈ CLINK)
- **OBSERVE:** Self-reference and frame (⊙ IMSCRIB, ∈ FSPLIT)
- **UPDATE:** Close and fix (∋ FFUSE, ⊡ IFIX)

Every complete cycle satisfies μ∘δ = id by construction.

### Catalog Integration  

Nine modules from upstream Grammar repositories (imasmic_core, IMSCRIBr, ALEPH_OS, priests-engine) run natively in the kernel. The catalog (`catalog.rs`, 954 lines) is the single source of truth for all data: no hardcoded constants, no ordinal arrays, no glyph strings exist outside it. New systems are registered at runtime via `register_entry()` without source edits.

## Capabilities

### Topological Quantum Computing  

The kernel braids Fibonacci anyons directly on the metal. The `fibqc` module compiles standard quantum gates to braid words and evaluates knot invariants (Jones polynomial) with no host runtime and no floating-point unit assumed.

### SIC-POVM Implementation  

The d=12 SIC-POVM campaign runs on bare metal via the `d12` REPL command. Five verified pillars:
1. **Phase-tower collapse:** 3→1 independent generators (8× reduction)
2. **Magnitude square-class group:** K₁₆, rank 5
3. **31-orbit Galois structure:** All 143/143 existence-grade overlaps ring-exact
4. **Dual-Link identification:** norm(N₁) = 1/32448², ramification {2,3,13}
5. **Belnap SIC unconditional:** SIC existence proven axiom-free in the Belnap multilattice for d=2ⁿ

### Belnap Paraconsistent Logic  

The Belnap FOUR lattice (T, F, B, N) is the paraconsistent foundation for the entire kernel. The `belnap_c4.rs` module implements a complex plane where i² = B (both-true-and-false), with Frobenius-verified arithmetic. The `belnap_shor.rs` module runs Shor's algorithm on Belnap FOUR, finding that the period r is encoded in the 2:1 coherence cost ratio between B-bias and T-bias.

### Clay Millennium Witnesses  

All seven Clay Millennium Problems are analyzed through the grammar, with IMASM witness programs for:
- **BSD:** Hodge theory witness
- **Hodge:** Mass gap witness  
- **Yang-Mills:** Regularity witness

The `frobenius_unify.rs` module unifies all four Frobenius conditions (kernel, grammar, catalog, SIC) as one machine-checked invariant.

### Red-Hot Rebis Integration  

All 20 modules from `red-hot_rebis/` and `gene_imscriber/` run as no_std Rust off the REPL:
- **p4ra:** Paraconsistent kernel
- **genetic:** Codon ↔ amino acid ↔ glyph translation
- **enzymes:** 109 enzyme tuples with catalytic mechanisms
- **ligand:** Functional group binding design
- **frustration:** Residue-residue energetic frustration matrices

### Cross-Dialect Navigation  

The kernel can navigate between 12 dialects with different structural rulesets, gate thresholds, and absorption rules. The Crystal is invariant; the ruleset is a sheaf that determines what each address *does*. Eleven diaschizic compounds modulate gate thresholds and T-constitution at load time.

### Real x86 Execution  

`vox run <symbol> --args a,b <file>` lifts a function out of a real ELF binary and runs it, for real: `vox_core::imasm_module::emit` produces the payload-carrying twelve-glyph module (each glyph plus its actual registers, immediates, and memory operands, not just the bare structural word `weight`/`banked`/`cycle`/`imasm derive` read), and `vox_core::imasm_vm::Machine` interprets it with genuine registers, byte-addressed memory, flags, and ALU semantics — System V calling convention in, a real computed value out. Verified byte-for-byte against the standalone `vox` binary on a compiled `add(a,b)` function.

This runs one function at a time with scalar integer arguments and a single integer return, not a full process: `exit`/`exit_group` are the only real syscalls, every other syscall halts rather than pretending to succeed, and there is no dynamic linker, no `main`/argv/envp setup, no threads. Hosted builds only — it needs a filesystem to read the binary from.

## Why This Matters

**Self-verification:** Every tick satisfies μ∘δ = id by construction, not by testing.

**Zero external dependencies:** The kernel is pure no_std Rust with zero crates.

**Grammar-enforced correctness:** The 12-opcode grammar constrains what each token does; there is no undefined behavior.

**Bare-metal topological QC:** Fibonacci anyon braiding runs directly on hardware without a quantum runtime.

**Machine-checked witnesses:** Clay Millennium witnesses are IMASM programs, not prose claims.

**Runtime-extensible:** New systems register at runtime without source edits.
